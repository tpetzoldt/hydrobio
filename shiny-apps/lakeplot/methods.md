# Scientific background

## Thermocline and 10 degrees Celsius isotherme

The thermocline in the plots is calculated using the **R** package
[rLakeAnalyzer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rLakeAnalyzer/). Different
definitions and calculation methods exist for mixing depth ( $z_{mix}$ )
and thermocline, see for example the references in the rLakeAnalyzer
[documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rLakeAnalyzer/vignettes/sm_algorithm.html)
(Winslow et al. 2019)
As a simple rule of thumb, mixing depth can be estimated as the first
depth where the temperature gradient is more than one degree per meter
(1K/m).
The app uses the rLakeAnalyzer algorithm, to understand what
it does is left as an exercise (see below).

Both mixing depth and thermocline are somewhat complex. In reality,
hydrophysical gradients are continuous and change dynamically. "Fixed
boundaries" do not really exist, but they are good indicators and
helpful for further computations.  Another practical indicator is the
"10 degrees Celsius isotherme", that is even simpler and less
influenced by complex interactions.

## Oxygen saturation

Oxygen saturation is given by the ratio of the actual oxygen
concentration and the oxygen saturation concentration at the given
temperature. The saturation concentration can be approximated as a
function of water temperature and barometric pressure using the
equation of Mortimer (1981):

$$
C_{O2, sat} = \exp\left( 7.7117 − 1.31403 \cdot \log\left(T + 45.93\right)\right) \cdot
\frac{p}{1013.25}
$$

where $T$ is the temperature in degrees Celsius, and $p$ is the air
pressure in hectopascal. The resulting saturation concentration is in
units of gO/m$^3$ or mgO/l.

## Underwater light profile and euphotic zone

The underwater light $I_z$ ( $I=$ irradiation) in a particular depth
$z$ can be estimated from the light intensity immediately below the
water surface $I_0$ using Lambert-Beer's law:

$$
I_z = I_0 \cdot e^{-\varepsilon \cdot z}
$$

where it is assumed that the light extinction coefficient
$\varepsilon$ \(in some books also named $k_d$\) is constant over
depth. This is of course an approximation for mainly two reasons:

* light extinction depends on the light wavelength
* color and particles are evenly distributed over depth

The $\varepsilon$\-value measured with an underwater light sensor is a
mean value over depth and over a certain spectral range (the visible
light or the photosynthetic active part), so it can be called the
"mean vertical and mean spectral extinction coefficient".

It can be directly calculated from Lambert-Beer's law by linear
regresion of the log-transformed equation

$$
\ln(I_z) = \ln(I_0)  -\varepsilon \cdot z
$$

that is equivalent to a linear regression, where the coefficient
$b = \varepsilon$\:

$$
y = a  - b \cdot x
$$

## Limnological interactions between light, temperature, oxygen pH and conductivity

In aquatic ecosystems, hydrophysical, chemical and biological
variables are influenced by hydrology, meteorology and seasonal
forcing and influence each other. As a comprehensive description would
exceed the space here, we refer to the hydrobiology lecture and the
textbooks.

You may consider the following keywords and questions:

* seasonality and stratification patterns, e.g. dimictic, monomictic, polymictic
* influence of stratification on oxygen availability, oxygen consumption and production
* influence of trophic state on the shape of oxygen profile
* influence of phytosynthetic activity on pH and conductivity (refers to the calcium-carbonate balance)
* influence of climate warming on stratification duration
* influence of stratification duration on oxygen in the hypolimnion
* and more ...


# Exercises

* Download data from the course home page and compare temperature and
  light profiles. Search the internet for background information about
  the particular Lakes and Reservoirs and discuss how the profile
  characteristics are related to the lakes. Can you find agreements
  and disagreements? Are they plausible or surprising?
* Compare the rLakeAnalyzer thermocline with the 1K/m rule.
* Try to reproduce the results with Libreoffice, Excel or an own R
  script.
* Compare the extinction coefficients with data from a limnology
  textbook e.g., Lampert and Sommer (2007), Figure 3.4

# (Bonus) Recreate the plots in R

Below, the source code to calculate the 10°C isotherme, thermocline
depth and 1% light depth, and create the plots shown in this
application is provided. It is not required to understand this or to
be able to recreate the plots in R. Nevertheless, some skills using
the statistical programming language R can be advantageous in your
future (academic) career and there are lots of good resources to learn
it online.
